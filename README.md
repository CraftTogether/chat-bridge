# Minecraft Chat Bridge
A simple, efficient 3 way bridge between Discord, IRC (optional) and Minecraft, using 
[JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA) and [IRCJ](https://gitlab.com/PolarianDev/ircj) <BR>

**Note:** This is not a Bridge which supports all 3 platforms, but bridges all 3 together, if you
are looking for a Bridge between IRC and Discord see [Bridge.Net](https://gitlab.com/PolarianDev/bridge.net)

**WARNING:** <BR>
as of v1.3 Chat Bridge depends on [CraftCore]() and [Weg](), these must be present in the `plugin` folder/directory or Chat Bridge will  not work!

As of v1.2 Chat Bridge depends on [kelp](https://github.com/CraftTogether/Kelp), [Rinku](https://github.com/CraftTogether/Rinku) and [Weg](https://github.com/CraftTogether/weg), these all must be present in the `plugin` folder/directory or Chat Bridge will not work! 

As of v1.1 Chat Bridge depends on the [kelp](https://github.com/CraftTogether/Kelp) plugin, which provides the discord connectivity, the plugin will not load without the kelp dependency therefore it must also be added to your `plugins` directory/folder
